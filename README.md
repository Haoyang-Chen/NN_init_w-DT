# pytorch_djinn

This is a PyTorch implementation of deep jointly-informed neural networks, [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00784), [original repo here](https://github.com/LLNL/DJINN). My implementation more geared more toward classification, as that is what I was exploring, and as such the demo is set up for classification, and most of the implementation has classification in mind. Regression seems to have some bugs still lingering throughout, which will eventually be squashed. In the meantime, this implementation seems to converge in the same or fewer epochs than the original TensorFlow version, and it should work fine for classification. 

Future README updates will cover installation, demo, requirements, etc.
